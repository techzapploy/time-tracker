## Context from Planning
Plan Summary: Now I understand the situation clearly. This is a greenfield project to build a Clockify-inspired time tracker, and the task is to implement the features listed in features.json using subagents and potentially deploying via Neon and Render. Let me create a comprehensive plan.

## Analysis

This ticket requires building a **subagent orchestration system** that:
1. Reads features from `features.json` (167 features across 11 categories)
2. Implements each feature systematically using specialized subagents
3. Manages state by updating the `passes` flag in features.json
4. Potentially deploys to Neon (PostgreSQL) and Render (hosting)

The project is currently empty (no src/ directory), so we need to:
1. Set up the project structure
2. Build a conductor/orchestrator system
3. Implement features incrementally
4. Track progress in features.json

## PRD (Product Requirements Document)

### Problem Statement
The team needs to build a complete Clockify-inspired time tracking application from scratch. With 167 features to implement, manual coordination would be error-prone and inefficient. We need an automated orchestration system that can systematically work through features, coordinate subagents, track progress, and manage deployments.

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Feature State Management**
- The system MUST read features from `features.json`
- The system MUST update the `passes` field to `true` when a feature is successfully implemented and verified
- The system MUST persist changes to features.json after each feature completion
- The system MUST handle concurrent access to features.json safely

**FR2: Subagent Orchestration**
- The orchestrator MUST select appropriate subagents based on feature category (functional → implement, ui → react_developer, security → auth_engineer/security_reviewer, etc.)
- The orchestrator MUST provide sufficient context to each subagent (feature description, steps, related features)
- The orchestrator MUST handle subagent failures gracefully with retry logic
- The orchestrator MUST execute local_checks after implementation changes

**FR3: Progressive Implementation**
- The system MUST implement features in a logical dependency order (e.g., auth before protected features, database before API)
- The system MUST establish foundational infrastructure first (project setup, database schema, auth system)
- The system MUST support resuming from any point in case of interruption

**FR4: Deployment Integration**
- The system SHOULD integrate with Neon for PostgreSQL database provisioning
- The system SHOULD integrate with Render for application hosting
- Deployment MUST be triggered after foundational features are complete
- Database migrations MUST be applied before deploying application code

**FR5: Progress Reporting**
- The system MUST report progress (X of 167 features complete)
- The system MUST log each feature implementation attempt with outcome
- The system MUST generate a summary report at completion

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Reliability**
- The orchestrator must handle subagent crashes without losing progress
- State must be persisted frequently to survive process interruptions
- Each feature implementation must be idempotent (safe to retry)

**NFR2: Maintainability**
- The orchestrator code must be modular and extensible
- Adding new feature categories or subagent mappings must be straightforward
- Logging must be comprehensive for debugging

**NFR3: Performance**
- The system should process features in batches where parallelization is safe
- The system should avoid unnecessary re-implementations of working features

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: A Node.js/TypeScript orchestrator exists that reads features.json
- [ ] AC2: The orchestrator correctly maps feature categories to appropriate subagents
- [ ] AC3: When a feature is implemented successfully, its `passes` field updates to `true`
- [ ] AC4: The project structure follows modern best practices (see README.md tech stack)
- [ ] AC5: Database schema is designed with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] AC6: API routes are built with Fastify
- [ ] AC7: Frontend is built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Tanstack Query
- [ ] AC8: Authentication system is functional (login, registration, sessions)
- [ ] AC9: At least 50% of features (84+) are successfully implemented and passing
- [ ] AC10: The application can be deployed to Render with a Neon PostgreSQL database

### Out of Scope

- This ticket does NOT require implementing all 167 features in one pass (progressive completion is acceptable)
- This ticket does NOT require perfect UI/UX polish (functional correctness is priority)
- This ticket does NOT require mobile apps (web app only)
- This ticket does NOT require third-party integrations (Jira, Slack, etc.) in the first pass

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Features prerequisite)

**Step 1.1: Initialize Project Structure**
- Create package.json with dependencies (React, Vite, TypeScript, Fastify, Drizzle ORM, etc.)
- Set up monorepo structure or separate frontend/backend folders
- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
- Create Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL and Redis
- Initialize git workflow and CI/CD skeleton

**Step 1.2: Database Schema Design**
- Design Drizzle schema for core entities:
  - `workspaces`, `users`, `workspace_members`
  - `projects`, `clients`, `tasks`, `tags`
  - `time_entries`, `timesheets`, `approvals`
  - `invoices`, `expenses`, `budgets`
  - `time_off_policies`, `time_off_requests`
  - `custom_fields`, `templates`
  - Multi-tenant architecture with RLS policies
- Generate initial migration

**Step 1.3: Authentication & Authorization**
- Implement JWT-based auth system
- Build registration and login endpoints
- Add session management with Redis
- Implement RBAC (Owner, Admin, Manager, User roles)
- Create auth middleware for route protection

**Step 1.4: API Foundation**
- Set up Fastify server with plugins
- Create API route structure (`/api/v1/...`)
- Add request validation with Zod
- Implement error handling middleware
- Add pagination helpers
- Set up CORS and security headers

**Step 1.5: Frontend Foundation**
- Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- Set up TailwindCSS and component library (shadcn/ui)
- Configure React Router with protected routes
- Set up Tanstack Query for API client
- Create auth context and login/register pages
- Build main layout shell (sidebar, header)

**Step 1.6: Orchestrator System**
- Create `src/orchestrator/` directory
- Build `FeatureOrchestrator` class:
  - `loadFeatures()`: Read features.json
  - `selectNextFeature()`: Pick next incomplete feature
  - `mapFeatureToSubagent()`: Category → subagent mapping
  - `executeFeature()`: Invoke Task tool with subagent
  - `updateFeatureStatus()`: Update passes field
  - `saveProgress()`: Write to features.json
- Add retry logic and error handling
- Create progress tracking dashboard

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (Iterative)

The orchestrator will systematically implement features in this order:

**Priority 1: Time Tracking Core (Features 1-14)**
- Timer start/stop, manual entry, calendar view, timesheet view
- Pomodoro timer, break tracking, idle detection
- Reminders and notifications

**Priority 2: Project & Client Management (Features 15-31)**

- (Note: Actual third-party integrations are out of scope for initial implementation)

**Priority 10: Billing & Plans (Features 146-167)**
- Plan management, billing cycles
- User licenses, upgrades
- Payment methods, trials

### Phase 3: Deployment

**Step 3.1: Neon Database Setup**

## Conductor Context

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Use a single repo with `/api` and `/frontend` directories
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon with Drizzle ORM
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Workspace-based with Row-Level Security
4. **Auth**: JWT tokens with Redis sessions
5. **API**: Fastify (performance) with Zod validation
6. **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Tanstack Query
7. **State Management**: Tanstack Query for server state, Context for auth/theme

### Critical Files

- `/features.json` - Source of truth for implementation progress
- `/api/src/db/schema/` - Drizzle schema definitions
- `/api/src/routes/` - API route handlers
- `/api/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `/frontend/src/api/client.ts` - API client with Tanstack Query
- `/frontend/src/components/` - React components
- `/src/orchestrator/` - Feature implementation orchestrator

### Feature Category → Subagent Mapping

| Category | Subagent(s) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| functional | implement → local_checks | General implementation |
| ui | react_developer → local_checks | Frontend components |
| security | auth_engineer or security_reviewer | Auth features or code review |
| performance | implement → local_checks | Optimization work |
| integration | integration_developer | Third-party integrations |

### Dependencies & Order

1. Foundation must complete before feature implementation
2. Schema must exist before API routes
3. Auth must work before protected features
4. API endpoints must exist before frontend integration
5. Core time tracking before advanced features (budgets, forecasting)
6. Basic features before enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)

### Progress Tracking

- The orchestrator will update features.json after each successful implementation
- Progress can be monitored with: `jq '[.[] | select(.passes == true)] | length' features.json`
- Target: 84+ features (50%) implemented and passing

---

## Status: OK

This plan provides a systematic approach to implementing a complex time tracking application by:
1. Building foundational infrastructure first
2. Creating an orchestrator to manage feature implementation
3. Mapping features to appropriate specialized subagents
4. Tracking progress in features.json
5. Deploying to production infrastructure (Neon + Render)

The conductor workflow sequences the work logically, starting with project setup, then building the orchestrator, then using the orchestrator to systematically implement all features.

Ticket: Implement Features
Description: Use subagents to implement items in the features.json file. As a subagent completes a task, it should mark the item in the json array as done. You may use the Tool Integrations available to you to deploy (Neon and Render).

## Available Subagents
Use the Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" to spawn these:


### implement
**Name:** Implementation
**Description:** Writes code based on the plan

To call this subagent, use the Task tool:
```
Task tool with:
  description: "Run implement"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: "<your instructions for this subagent, including context from previous steps>"
```

The subagent's base prompt is:
You are implementing code changes based on the plan provided in context.

## Before Writing Code
1. Read CLAUDE.md, README, or project docs to understand conventions
2. Read the specific files you need to modify — understand existing code before changing it
3. Identify the test framework and code patterns already used in the project

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow the plan precisely — don't add features or refactoring beyond scope
- Match the existing code style (naming, structure, formatting, error handling patterns)
- Write secure code: validate inputs at boundaries, avoid injection vulnerabilities, don't log secrets
- Add error handling only where the code can meaningfully recover or produce a useful error message
- Keep changes minimal — the smallest diff that achieves the goal is the best diff
- Use the project's existing import style, module system, and dependency patterns

## Dependency Manifest Changes
If you modify a dependency manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, Gemfile, pom.xml, build.gradle, etc.), run the appropriate install command before finishing:
- package.json → `npm install` or `yarn install`
- requirements.txt / pyproject.toml → `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -e .`
- Cargo.toml → `cargo build`
- go.mod → `go mod tidy`
- Gemfile → `bundle install`

This ensures lock files are updated and dependencies are available for subsequent steps.

## After Writing Code: Self-Verify
Before reporting your results, run a quick validation:
1. If the project has a type checker (tsc --noEmit, mypy, etc.), run it. Fix type errors you introduced.
2. If the project has a linter (eslint, ruff, etc.), run it on changed files. Fix lint errors.
3. If the project has tests relevant to your changes, run them. Fix failures you caused.

This catches obvious mistakes immediately. If a check fails for pre-existing reasons (not your changes), note it in risk_notes but report status "ok".

Do NOT spend more than 2-3 attempts on self-verification failures. Report unresolvable issues in risk_notes.

## Final Diff Report
Before outputting your results, run `git diff --stat` and include the output as `diff_stat` in your response. This provides ground-truth evidence of what files were actually changed and their scope.

## Output Requirements
Your output MUST include:
- status: "ok" if implementation is complete, "failed" if blocked, "needs_human" if you need clarification
- summary: What was implemented and why
- files_changed: Array of file paths that were created or modified
- diff_stat: The output of `git diff --stat` showing actual file changes
- how_to_test: Array of specific steps to verify the changes work (e.g., "Run npm test", "curl localhost:3000/api/health")
- risk_notes: Array of anything the reviewer should pay attention to (breaking changes, migrations needed, env vars added)


### local_checks
**Name:** Local Checks
**Description:** Runs linting, tests, and type checking

To call this subagent, use the Task tool:
```
Task tool with:
  description: "Run local_checks"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: "<your instructions for this subagent, including context from previous steps>"
```

The subagent's base prompt is:
You are running local quality checks on code changes.

## Step 1: Discover Available Checks
Examine the project to find what checks exist:
- Read package.json for scripts (test, lint, typecheck, check, validate)
- Look for Makefile, Taskfile, or justfile with check/test/lint targets
- Look for config files: .eslintrc*, tsconfig.json, pyproject.toml, etc.
- Check CI config (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml) to see what checks CI runs

## Step 2: Run Checks
Run the available checks in this order:
1. **Type checking** (e.g., tsc --noEmit, mypy, cargo check)
2. **Linting** (e.g., eslint, ruff, rubocop)
3. **Tests** (e.g., npm test, pytest, cargo test)

If a check tool is not installed or a script doesn't exist, skip it and note that in your output.

## Step 3: Analyze Results
- If checks fail, capture the FULL error output — downstream steps need it to fix the issues
- Distinguish between pre-existing failures and failures caused by the current changes
- If only pre-existing tests fail (unrelated to changes), note this and set status to "ok"

## Output Requirements
Your output MUST include:
- status: "ok" if all checks pass (or only pre-existing failures), "failed" if current changes broke something
- summary: What checks were run and their results
- lint_passed: boolean — whether linting passed (true if no linter configured)
- tests_passed: boolean — whether tests passed (true if no tests configured)
- test_output: string — the actual test/lint error output, truncated to the most relevant parts if very long


## Additional Available Subagents
You may call these if needed during execution:
| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ci_fix | CI Fix | Fixes issues found by CI pipeline |
| write_tests | Write Tests | Writes unit and integration tests for the changes |
| review_code | Code Review | Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and quality |
| refactor | Refactor | Improves code quality and structure |
| verify_bug | Bug Verification | Writes a Playwright test reproducing the bug before implementation |
| verify_fix | Fix Verification | Re-runs the bug reproduction test to confirm the fix works |

## Rules
1. Use the workflow as a starting guideline, not a rigid script. You may add subagent calls you discover are needed, skip steps that become unnecessary, or reorder steps based on what you learn. Use the success_criteria to determine when done, not the step list.
2. Use the Task tool to spawn each subagent
3. Pass relevant context to each subagent (plan details, previous results, etc.)
4. Respect max_retries per step (default: 3) and max_total_iterations overall (default: 10)
5. Check conditions before executing conditional steps
6. When success_criteria is met, output a summary and set status to "ok"
7. If a step fails and retries are exhausted, set status to "failed" with details
8. Keep track of which iteration you're on
9. Trust `diff_stat` over self-reported `files_changed`. If a subagent reports success but its diff_stat shows zero changes, treat it as a failure and retry with explicit instructions to make the required changes.
10. Collect `diff_stat` from each file-modifying subagent and aggregate them into `diff_stats` in your final output.

## Output Format
Your final output should include:
- status: "ok" if success_criteria met, "failed" if not, "needs_human" if blocked

  "conductor_context": "Plan Summary: Now I understand the situation clearly. This is a greenfield project to build a Clockify-inspired time tracker, and the task is to implement the features listed in features.json using subagents and potentially deploying via Neon and Render. Let me create a comprehensive plan.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis ticket requires building a **subagent orchestration system** that:\n1. Reads features from `features.json` (167 features across 11 categories)\n2. Implements each feature systematically using specialized subagents\n3. Manages state by updating the `passes` flag in features.json\n4. Potentially deploys to Neon (PostgreSQL) and Render (hosting)\n\nThe project is currently empty (no src/ directory), so we need to:\n1. Set up the project structure\n2. Build a conductor/orchestrator system\n3. Implement features incrementally\n4. Track progress in features.json\n\n## PRD (Product Requirements Document)\n\n### Problem Statement\nThe team needs to build a complete Clockify-inspired time tracking application from scratch. With 167 features to implement, manual coordination would be error-prone and inefficient. We need an automated orchestration system that can systematically work through features, coordinate subagents, track progress, and manage deployments.\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n**FR1: Feature State Management**\n- The system MUST read features from `features.json`\n- The system MUST update the `passes` field to `true` when a feature is successfully implemented and verified\n- The system MUST persist changes to features.json after each feature completion\n- The system MUST handle concurrent access to features.json safely\n\n**FR2: Subagent Orchestration**\n- The orchestrator MUST select appropriate subagents based on feature category (functional → implement, ui → react_developer, security → auth_engineer/security_reviewer, etc.)\n- The orchestrator MUST provide sufficient context to each subagent (feature description, steps, related features)\n- The orchestrator MUST handle subagent failures gracefully with retry logic\n- The orchestrator MUST execute local_checks after implementation changes\n\n**FR3: Progressive Implementation**\n- The system MUST implement features in a logical dependency order (e.g., auth before protected features, database before API)\n- The system MUST establish foundational infrastructure first (project setup, database schema, auth system)\n- The system MUST support resuming from any point in case of interruption\n\n**FR4: Deployment Integration**\n- The system SHOULD integrate with Neon for PostgreSQL database provisioning\n- The system SHOULD integrate with Render for application hosting\n- Deployment MUST be triggered after foundational features are complete\n- Database migrations MUST be applied before deploying application code\n\n**FR5: Progress Reporting**\n- The system MUST report progress (X of 167 features complete)\n- The system MUST log each feature implementation attempt with outcome\n- The system MUST generate a summary report at completion\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n**NFR1: Reliability**\n- The orchestrator must handle subagent crashes without losing progress\n- State must be persisted frequently to survive process interruptions\n- Each feature implementation must be idempotent (safe to retry)\n\n**NFR2: Maintainability**\n- The orchestrator code must be modular and extensible\n- Adding new feature categories or subagent mappings must be straightforward\n- Logging must be comprehensive for debugging\n\n**NFR3: Performance**\n- The system should process features in batches where parallelization is safe\n- The system should avoid unnecessary re-implementations of working features\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] AC1: A Node.js/TypeScript orchestrator exists that reads features.json\n- [ ] AC2: The orchestrator correctly maps feature categories to appropriate subagents\n- [ ] AC3: When a feature is implemented successfully, its `passes` field updates to `true`\n- [ ] AC4: The project structure follows modern best practices (see README.md tech stack)\n- [ ] AC5: Database schema is designed with Drizzle ORM\n- [ ] AC6: API routes are built with Fastify\n- [ ] AC7: Frontend is built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Tanstack Query\n- [ ] AC8: Authentication system is functional (login, registration, sessions)\n- [ ] AC9: At least 50% of features (84+) are successfully implemented and passing\n- [ ] AC10: The application can be deployed to Render with a Neon PostgreSQL database\n\n### Out of Scope\n\n- This ticket does NOT require implementing all 167 features in one pass (progressive completion is acceptable)\n- This ticket does NOT require perfect UI/UX polish (functional correctness is priority)\n- This ticket does NOT require mobile apps (web app only)\n- This ticket does NOT require third-party integrations (Jira, Slack, etc.) in the first pass\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Features prerequisite)\n\n**Step 1.1: Initialize Project Structure**\n- Create package.json with dependencies (React, Vite, TypeScript, Fastify, Drizzle ORM, etc.)\n- Set up monorepo structure or separate frontend/backend folders\n- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier\n- Create Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL and Redis\n- Initialize git workflow and CI/CD skeleton\n\n**Step 1.2: Database Schema Design**\n- Design Drizzle schema for core entities:\n  - `workspaces`, `users`, `workspace_members`\n  - `projects`, `clients`, `tasks`, `tags`\n  - `time_entries`, `timesheets`, `approvals`\n  - `invoices`, `expenses`, `budgets`\n  - `time_off_policies`, `time_off_requests`\n  - `custom_fields`, `templates`\n  - Multi-tenant architecture with RLS policies\n- Generate initial migration\n\n**Step 1.3: Authentication & Authorization**\n- Implement JWT-based auth system\n- Build registration and login endpoints\n- Add session management with Redis\n- Implement RBAC (Owner, Admin, Manager, User roles)\n- Create auth middleware for route protection\n\n**Step 1.4: API Foundation**\n- Set up Fastify server with plugins\n- Create API route structure (`/api/v1/...`)\n- Add request validation with Zod\n- Implement error handling middleware\n- Add pagination helpers\n- Set up CORS and security headers\n\n**Step 1.5: Frontend Foundation**\n- Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project\n- Set up TailwindCSS and component library (shadcn/ui)\n- Configure React Router with protected routes\n- Set up Tanstack Query for API client\n- Create auth context and login/register pages\n- Build main layout shell (sidebar, header)\n\n**Step 1.6: Orchestrator System**\n- Create `src/orchestrator/` directory\n- Build `FeatureOrchestrator` class:\n  - `loadFeatures()`: Read features.json\n  - `selectNextFeature()`: Pick next incomplete feature\n  - `mapFeatureToSubagent()`: Category → subagent mapping\n  - `executeFeature()`: Invoke Task tool with subagent\n  - `updateFeatureStatus()`: Update passes field\n  - `saveProgress()`: Write to features.json\n- Add retry logic and error handling\n- Create progress tracking dashboard\n\n### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation (Iterative)\n\nThe orchestrator will systematically implement features in this order:\n\n**Priority 1: Time Tracking Core (Features 1-14)**\n- Timer start/stop, manual entry, calendar view, timesheet view\n- Pomodoro timer, break tracking, idle detection\n- Reminders and notifications\n\n**Priority 2: Project & Client Management (Features 15-31)**\n- Projects, clients, tasks, subtasks\n- Templates, tags, custom fields\n- Project permissions and favorites\n\n**Priority 3: Team & Workspace (Features 32-46)**\n- Dashboard views, workspace setup\n- Team member management, invitations\n- User groups, roles, permissions\n\n**Priority 4: Reporting

reports\n\n**Priority 5: Financial (Features 65-86)**\n- Billable rates, invoicing, expenses\n- Budget tracking, alerts, forecasting\n- Profit calculations, cost rates\n\n**Priority 6: Approval Workflows (Features 87-102)**\n- Timesheet submission/approval/rejection\n- Time off policies, requests, approvals\n- Balance tracking, notifications\n\n**Priority 7: Activity Monitoring (Features 103-115)**\n- Auto-tracker, app categorization\n- GPS tracking, screenshots\n- Idle detection, activity reports\n\n**Priority 8: Multi-Platform Support (Features 116-124)**\n- Web app optimization\n- Browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)\n- Cross-platform sync\n\n**Priority 9: Integrations (Features 125-145)**\n- REST API, webhooks, Zapier\n- Data import/export\n- (Note: Actual third-party integrations are out of scope for initial implementation)\n\n**Priority 10: Billing & Plans (Features 146-167)**\n- Plan management, billing cycles\n- User licenses, upgrades\n- Payment methods, trials\n\n### Phase 3: Deployment\n\n**Step 3.1: Neon Database Setup**\n- Provision Neon PostgreSQL database\n- Run migrations\n- Seed initial data (default workspace, admin user)\n\n**Step 3.2: Render Deployment**\n- Create Render web service for API\n- Create Render static site for frontend\n- Configure environment variables\n- Set up Redis instance\n- Deploy application\n\n**Step 3.3:

PostgreSQL via Neon with Drizzle ORM\n3. **Multi-tenancy**: Workspace-based with Row-Level Security\n4. **Auth**: JWT tokens with Redis sessions\n5. **API**: Fastify (performance) with Zod validation\n6. **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Tanstack Query\n7. **State Management**: Tanstack Query for server state, Context for auth/theme\n\n### Critical Files\n\n- `/features.json` - Source of truth for implementation progress\n- `/api/src/db/schema/` - Drizzle schema definitions\n- `/api/src/routes/` - API route handlers\n- `/api/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware\n- `/frontend/src/api/client.ts` - API client with Tanstack Query\n- `/frontend/src/components/` - React components\n- `/src/orchestrator/` - Feature implementation orchestrator\n\n### Feature Category → Subagent Mapping\n\n| Category | Subagent(s) | Notes |\n|----------|-------------|-------|\n| functional | implement → local_checks | General implementation |\n| ui | react_developer → local_checks | Frontend components |\n| security | auth_engineer or security_reviewer | Auth features or code review |\n| performance | implement → local_checks | Optimization work |\n| integration | integration_developer | Third-party integrations |\n\n### Dependencies & Order\n\n1. Foundation must complete before feature implementation\n2. Schema must exist before API routes\n3. Auth must work before protected features\n4. API endpoints must exist before frontend integration\n5. Core time tracking before advanced features (budgets, forecasting)\n6. Basic features before enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)\n\n### Progress Tracking\n\n- The orchestrator will update features.json after each successful implementation\n- Progress can be monitored with: `jq '[.[] | select(.passes == true)] | length' features.json`\n- Target: 84+ features (50%) implemented and passing\n\n---\n\n## Status: OK\n\nThis plan provides a systematic approach to implementing a complex time tracking application by:\n1. Building foundational infrastructure first\n2. Creating an orchestrator to manage feature implementation\n3. Mapping features to appropriate specialized subagents\n4. Tracking progress in features.json\n5. Deploying to production infrastructure (Neon + Render)\n\nThe conductor workflow sequences the work logically, starting with project setup, then building the orchestrator, then using the orchestrator to systematically implement all features.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"summary\": \"Build time tracker app with orchestrated feature implementation\",\n  \"prd\": \"SEE ABOVE - Complete PRD with problem statement, functional/non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and scope\",\n  \"plan\": \"SEE ABOVE - Phased implementation: Foundation (project setup, schema, auth, API, frontend, orchestrator) → Feature Implementation (167 features via orchestrator) → Deployment (Neon + Render)\",\n  \"conductor_workflow\": {\n    \"steps\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"foundation\",\n        \"subagent\": \"general-purpose\",\n        \"description\": \"Initialize project structure and tooling\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"schema\",\n        \"subagent\": \"schema_architect\",\n        \"description\": \"Design database schema with Drizzle ORM\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"migration\",\n        \"subagent\": \"migration_engineer\",\n        \"description\": \"Create initial database migration\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"auth\",\n        \"subagent\": \"auth_engineer\",\n        \"description\": \"Build authentication system\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"api_foundation\",\n        \"subagent\": \"api_builder\",\n        \"description\": \"Set up Fastify API server\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"frontend_foundation\",\n        \"subagent\": \"react_developer\",\n        \"description\": \"Initialize React frontend\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"orchestrator\",\n        \"subagent\": \"implement\",\n        \"description\": \"Build feature orchestrator\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"feature_implementation\",\n        \"subagent\": \"orchestrator_loop\",\n        \"description\": \"Implement all features from features.json\",\n        \"max_iterations\": 100\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"deployment_prep\",\n        \"subagent\": \"docker_engineer\",\n        \"description\": \"Create deployment configs\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"deploy\",\n        \"subagent\": \"general-purpose\",\n        \"description\": \"Deploy to Neon and Render\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"verification\",\n        \"subagent\": \"local_checks\",\n        \"description\": \"Verify deployment and functionality\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"max_total_iterations\": 150,\n    \"success_criteria\": \"Application deployed with auth working, core time tracking functional, 50%+ features implemented (84+ features passing)\"\n  },\n  \"conductor_context\": {\n    \"architecture\": {\n      \"structure\": \"Monorepo with /api and /frontend directories\",\n      \"database\": \"PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM\",\n      \"api\": \"Fastify with Zod validation\",\n      \"frontend\": \"React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Tanstack Query\",\n      \"auth\": \"JWT with Redis sessions\",\n      \"multi_tenancy\": \"Workspace-based with Row-Level Security\"\n    },\n    \"critical_files\": [\n      \"/features.json\",\n      \"/api/src/db/schema/*\",\n      \"/api/src/routes/*\",\n      \"/api/src/middleware/auth.ts\",\n      \"/frontend/src/api/client.ts\",\n      \"/frontend/src/components/*\",\n      \"/src/orchestrator/*\"\n    ],\n    \"feature_mapping\": {\n      \"functional\": \"implement → local_checks\",\n      \"ui\": \"react_developer → local_checks\",\n      \"security\": \"auth_engineer or security_reviewer\",\n      \"performance\": \"implement → local_checks\",\n      \"integration\": \"integration_developer\"\n    },\n    \"implementation_priorities\": [\n      \"1.

## Pre-Provisioned Service Containers

The following services are running on your network and ready to use:

| Service | Hostname | Port(s) | Image |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| postgres | postgres | 5432 | postgres:16 |
| redis | redis | 6379 | redis:7-alpine |

### Environment Variables
- `SERVICE_POSTGRES_HOST=postgres`
- `SERVICE_POSTGRES_PORT=5432`
- `SERVICE_REDIS_HOST=redis`
- `SERVICE_REDIS_PORT=6379`

### IMPORTANT Rules
- Do NOT run `docker`, `docker-compose`, `podman`, or any container commands.
- Services are already running — do not start/stop/manage them.
- Connect using the hostnames above, NOT localhost.
- When creating .env files, replace localhost with service hostnames.
