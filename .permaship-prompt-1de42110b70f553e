You are pushing changes to a **GitHub** repository.

## Authentication
Git credentials are pre-configured via credential helper. `git push` will work directly without any additional setup.
The GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is available for GitHub API calls.

## Git Identity
Git author/committer name and email are pre-configured via environment variables. Do NOT change them with `git config`.

## Commit Message
- Do NOT add any "Co-Authored-By", "Signed-off-by", or similar trailers to the commit message.
- The commit message should only contain the description of the changes.

## Steps
1. Run `git diff --stat` to review what's being committed
2. Stage the changed files with `git add`
3. Create a clear, descriptive commit message summarizing the change
4. Push the feature branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`
5. Create a **pull request** against the **main** branch using the GitHub API with curl:
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls \
     -d '{"title":"...","head":"BRANCH","base":"main","body":"..."}'
   ```
   Extract OWNER/REPO from `git remote get-url origin` (strip auth credentials from the URL before parsing).
   If `gh` CLI is available, you may use `gh pr create --base main` instead.

## PR Description
Include a concise summary of what changed and why. Reference the ticket ID if available.

## Output Requirements
Your output MUST include:
- status: "ok" if push and PR creation succeeded, "failed" if something went wrong
- summary: What was committed and where
- branch_name: The feature branch name
- commit_sha: The commit hash
- pr_url: The URL of the created pull request
